### Git for Professional

# The perfect Commit (1:27)

Golden rule of version control is 
> Commit will be the combined changes of same topic

Lets make an example 
> suppose we have  `index.html` file and we have  multiple changes on it  but our commit will be the combined changes of same topic . so we need to stage only some changes for being commited . in git we can do this by this *command* `git add -p index.html`




# Some Useful Command 
> Typing this command `git reset <filename>` git will  not be staged anymore after adding in stage area by `git add <filename>`
